\begin{abstract}

We developed a novel implementation of a \gls{loss} function; the empirical \gls{flipprobability}, derived from the flip probability developed by Durrant \& Kab\'an \cite{durrant2013sharp}. \gls{loss} and tested it in several canonical versions of convolution neural networks to assess whether an increase in training speed or \gls{generalisationperformance} could be achieved. While the \gls{lossfunction} can be used to train networks of a reasonably high accuracy, the performance is generally worse than when standard a standard \gls{lossfunction} and architecture is used.
